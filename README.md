# 📊 Placement-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing student placements using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning models**. Key predictors include **CGPA, internships, and academic streams**. The best-performing models were **Decision Tree and Random Forest**, achieving **87.73% accuracy**.

## 🚀 Key Findings
- **CGPA & Internships**: Higher CGPA and internship experience significantly improve placement chances.
- **Stream Influence**: Computer Science & IT students had higher placement rates than Mechanical & Civil Engineering.
- **Model Performance**:
  - **Decision Tree & Random Forest**: 87.73% accuracy
  - **XGBoost**: 87.60% accuracy
  - **KNN**: 85.18% accuracy

## 📈 Recommendations
### 🎓 For Students:
- Maintain a **high CGPA** (above 7.07).
- Gain **internship experience** to improve employability.
- Develop **technical skills** relevant to industry demands.

### 🏫 For Institutions:
- Align the **curriculum with industry needs**.
- Provide **mentorship & career counseling**.
- Offer **technical training programs** in high-demand areas.

### 🏢 For Recruiters:
